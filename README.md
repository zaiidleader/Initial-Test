# React Native SDE Mini Project

Make an ReactNative app to demonstrate the following requirements:
<br />This is an social media application that can post a text information to internet anonymously and let the community engage that post, we will call it Postr

## Requirements

- Timeline or newsfeed screen
- Create a new post screen
- Reply to a post screen

## The app must have 3 screens:
  The app must have following abilities:

    - Every user will have unique and random handler (username)
    - Create post a text with maximum character length: 100
    - Reply users’ posts with maximum character length: 100
    - List all users’ newest posts with infinite scroll capabilities
    - User can change UI language into several languages

As this is ReactNative role, you can use any mock api services and focus on your ReactNative code. You can use any UI-Kit or just plain UI.

## Bonus Points
We have bonus points if your application has this functionality: <br />
- The application has offline and resume capabilities because of bad network connectivity.
<br />For example: users at rural areas, low data package, or just sudden no network connectivity
- Record users’ longitude and latitude for each post
